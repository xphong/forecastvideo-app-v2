# [ForecastVideo-app](http://forecastvideo.phonghuynh.ca/)
A responsive weather app that uses the [Forecast.io API v2](https://developer.forecast.io
) to query for current weather conditions while displaying a looping weather video in the background using [BigVideo.js](http://dfcb.github.io/BigVideo.js/
)

Automatically updates forecast every 15 minutes in celsius format, also updates and gets current time/date.

Location is your current location using the ipinfo.io API. If the API does not work the location is defaulted to Toronto, Canada.

Mobile uses a background image since videos do not autoplay on mobile devices.
